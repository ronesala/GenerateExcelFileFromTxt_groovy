# GenerateExcelFileFromTxt_groovy
I had txt file with lables and texts in lv and had to move it to excel file to get translations from business. So, I made this script that generates excel file. 

ganerateExcelFileFromTxt.groovy - main and only groovy file for this
input.txt - txt file with lables and original language translations
output.xls - generated xls file

## input.txt text format
  Lable_key = lable text
  [example: MY_NAME = Mani sauc Krista]
