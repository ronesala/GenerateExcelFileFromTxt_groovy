# GenerateExcelFileFromTxt_groovy
I had txt file with labels and texts in lv and had to move it to excel file to get translations from business. So, I made this script that generates excel file. 

ganerateExcelFileFromTxt.groovy - main and only groovy file for this
input.txt - txt file with labels and original language translations
output.xls - generated xls file

## input.txt text format
  Label_key = label text
  [example: MY_NAME = Mani sauc Krista]
