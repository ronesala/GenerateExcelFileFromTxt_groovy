# Ideas and things to do:

- [ ] check if it's possible to lock cells in a JXL-generated Excel document
- [ ] add automatic translations (maybe - **https://libretranslate.com/**)
- [ ] generate txt file after getting the translations (can run separately)
- [ ] Information form Formula (Label = text) info in separate and locked sheet  
- [ ] Add check if .xls file is open (skip the error if is)
